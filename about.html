            <p class="white-text">brownish studio is a shared creative practice by hazel and azlan. it lives primarily in jewellery, but expands into objects, wearables aesthetics, and experiments with form.</p>
            <p class="white-text">Our work is rooted in hands-on making and informed by years of manufacturing (+ sourcing) experience. We believe jewellery is a form of creative care; a wearable archive of memory and identity.</p>
            <p class="white-text">If you’re a fellow creative looking to bring an idea into the physical world, we’re always happy to collaborate and share knowledge! we make most of our friends’ engagement rings (-: </p>
